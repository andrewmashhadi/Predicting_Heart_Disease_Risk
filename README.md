# Predicting the Ten Year Risk of Future Heart Disease

Every year, cardiovascular disease accounts for nearly 18 million lives and more than 4 out of 5 cardiovascular deaths are due
to heart attacks and strokes (WHO). Reducing cardiovascular deaths starts with identifying the disease early. Demographics,
medical history, genetics, and behavioral risks can help detect an early prognosis. With the abundance of medical data
collection, a natural question arises: Would combining these factors with machine learning models help aid early detection?
In this project, we will investigate various binary classifiers and the factors most pertinent to predicting the 10-year risk of
future heart disease. Note that this project was also intended to improve upon the methodology of a prior presentation given
in Stats 402 using new methods and techniques introduced in this course, Stats 412.
